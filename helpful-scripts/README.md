# Helpful Scripts

Welcome to the collection of Python scripts developed during the creation of the app. These scripts provide valuable insights into the squat detection logic and the data flow within the smartphone application.

## Understanding the Development Process

If you're curious about how the app was built, I recommend exploring these scripts in the following order:


1. [phyphox_magnetometer.py](phyphox_magnetometer.py)
2. [phyphox_accelerometer_with_g.py](phyphox_accelerometer_with_g.py)
3. [no_squat.py](no_squat.py)
4. [four_squats.py](four_squats.py)
5. [count_peaks.py](count_peaks.py)
6. [realtime_z_plot.py](realtime_z_plot.py)
7. [realtime_peaks_plotter.py](realtime_peaks_plotter.py)
8. [realtime_peaks_detector.py](realtime_peaks_detector.py)
9. [realtime_squat_counter.py](realtime_squat_counter.py)
10. [meter_test.py](meter_test.py)
11. [text_to_speech.py](text_to_speech.py)
12. [simple_squatCounter_GUI.py](simple_squatCounter_GUI.py)
